Dicer - OBO ID range library
============================

Dicer is a Java library and a command-line tool to facilitate the
manipulation of OBO Foundry-style _ID range policies_, the likes of
which are generated by the [Ontology Development
Kit](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit) and used by
the [Protégé ontology editor](https://github.com/protegeproject/protege).

The name of this project comes from _Dicer-1_ (_Dcr-1_), a _Drosophila
melanogaster_ gene coding for an enzyme involved in the short
interfering RNA gene silencing pathway.


Command-line usage
------------------
The command-line tool currently allows performing three tasks:

* validating an ID range policy (checking that it is syntactically
  correct, and also that the defined ID ranges do not overlap);
* re-serialising a policy file;
* allocate a new range of a given size (automatically finding the lowest
  available range).

To validate a policy file:

```sh
$ dicer-cli --input myont-idranges.owl
```

The command will exit with a return code of zero if the file contains a
valid policy; otherwise, an error message will be printed and the
command will exit with a non-zero value.

To re-serialise a policy file:

```sh
$ dicer-cli --input myont-idranges.owl --output reserialised.owl
```

To allocate a range of 50,000 IDs to the user _Alice_:

```sh
$ dicer-cli --input myont-idranges.owl --add-range Alice --size 50000 \
            --output edited.owl
dicer-cli: Allocated range [100000..150000) for user "Alice"
```

Beware that the command-line syntax is currently not fixed at all, so it
may very well change completely as new features are added to the tool.


Building
--------
Build by running `mvn clean package`. This will produce two distinct Jar
files:

* `dicer-lib-x.y.z.jar` (in `lib/target`): the Dicer library proper, for
  use in Java programs;
* `dicer-cli-z.y.z.jar` (in `cli/target`): the `dicer-cli` command-line
  tool, as a self-sufficient executable Jar archive.


Homepage and repository
-----------------------
At some point the project will be located at
<https://incenp.org/dvlpt/dicer/>, where the documentation (when it will
exist!) will be located. The source code is available in a Git
repository at <https://github.com/gouttegd/dicer>.
