Dicer - OBO ID range library
============================

Dicer is a Java library and a command-line tool to facilitate the
manipulation of OBO Foundry-style _ID policies_, the likes of which are
generated by the [Ontology Development
Kit](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit) and used by
the [Protégé ontology editor](https://github.com/protegeproject/protege).

The name of this project comes from _Dicer-1_ (_Dcr-1_), a _Drosophila
melanogaster_ gene coding for an enzyme involved in the short
interfering RNA gene silencing pathway.


Command-line usage
------------------

* Validating a policy file:

```sh
$ dicer-cli policy myont-idranges.owl
```

* Listing the ranges in a ID policy file:

```sh
$ dicer-cli policy myont-idranges.owl --list
Alice: [0..10000)
Bob: [50000..60000)
```

* Allocating a new range:

```sh
$ dicer-cli myont-idranges.owl --add-range Charlie --size 20000
dicer-cli: Allocated range [10000..30000) for user "Charlie"
```

* Filling a TSV file with auto-generated IDs:

```sh
$ dicer-cli tsv input.tsv \
            --policy myont-idranges.owl \
            --range Alice \
            --column 2 \
            --output output.tsv
```


Building
--------
Build by running `mvn clean package`. This will produce two distinct Jar
files:

* `dicer-lib-x.y.z.jar` (in `lib/target`): the Dicer library proper, for
  use in Java programs;
* `dicer-cli-z.y.z.jar` (in `cli/target`): the `dicer-cli` command-line
  tool, as a self-sufficient executable Jar archive.


Homepage and repository
-----------------------
The project is located at <https://incenp.org/dvlpt/dicer/>, where some
(currently very sparse) documentation is also hosted. The source code is
available in a Git repository at <https://github.com/gouttegd/dicer>.
